py2exe is a Python Distutils extension which converts Python scripts into executable Windows programs, able to run without requiring a Python installation.

py2exe was originally developed by Thomas Heller. Jimmy Retzlaff and Mark Hammond have also made contributions. Code contributions are always welcome from the community and many people provide invaluable help on the mailing list and the Wiki.
