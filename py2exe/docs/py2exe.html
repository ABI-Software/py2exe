<h1>py2exe</h1>
<h2>Build standalone window programs from python scripts</h2>
<p>    Copyright (C) 2000, <a href="mailto:theller@users.sourceforge.net">Thomas Heller</a></p>


<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>    <strong>py2exe</strong> is a distutils extension to compile python scripts into
    executable windows programs.</p>


<h2>Using <strong>py2exe</strong></h2>
<p>    Assuming you have a python script <code>myscript.py</code> which you
    want to convert into an executable windows program.
    Write the <em>distutils</em> setup script as usual, including the statement
    <code>import py2exe</code> before calling the setup function.
    Here's a simple setup script:</p>
<PRE>
         from distutils.core import setup
         import py2exe
         setup(name=&quot;myscript&quot;,
               scripts=[&quot;myscript.py&quot;],
         )

</PRE>

<p>    Running:</p>
<PRE>
        python setup.py py2exe --help

</PRE>

<p>    will display all available command-line flags for the <strong>py2exe</strong> command.</p>

<p>    Now you can call the setup script like this:</p>
<PRE>
         python setup.py py2exe

</PRE>

<p>    and a sub-directory <code>dist\myscript</code> will be created,
    containing all the files <code>myscript.exe</code> and <code>python20.dll</code>.
    If your script uses c-extension modules, they will be copied here
    as well.</p>

<p>    These files are all what is needed to distribute for your program,
    even if the target computer doesn't have python installed.</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>    <strong>py2exe</strong> uses python's modulefinder to load your script and find all
    python and extension modules needed to run it. Pure python modules
    are compiled into <code>.pyc</code> or <code>.pyo</code> files in a temporary directory.
    A zip-Archive will be built, containing all files from this
    directory as well as your script, and appended to a custom python
    interpreter supplied with <strong>py2exe</strong>.</p>

<p>    Running this custom python interpreter, now called <code>myscript.exe</code>,
    will install an import hook so that the modules needed can be
    imported from the zip-archive, and your script will be started.</p>

<p>    In simple cases, only <code>pythonxx.dll</code> is needed in addition to
    <code>myscript.exe</code>. If, however, your script needs extension modules,
    unfortunately those cannot (currently) be included or imported
    from the zip-archive, so they are needed as separate files (and
    are copied into the <code>dist\myscript</code> directory).</p>


<h2>Reference</h2>
<p>    Command line flags for <strong>py2exe</strong></p>

<dl><dt>    <strong>debug (-d)</strong></dt><dd><p>Create runtime with debugging information.
    (default: create a release runtime)</p>

</dd>
<dt>    <strong>optimize (-On)</strong></dt><dd><p>optimization level: -O1 for "python -O", -O2 for "python -OO",
        and -O0 to disable (default: -O0)</p>

</dd></dl>
<p>    The following flags are not yet implemented:</p>

<dl><dt>    <strong>unbuffered (-u)</strong></dt><dd><p>unbuffered binary <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em></p>

</dd>
<dt>    <strong>unicode (-U)</strong></dt><dd><p>treat string literals as unicode</p>

</dd></dl>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>    Python 1.5, 1.6, or 2.0.</p>

<p>    <a href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/"">Distutils</a> is required.
    It is included in Python 1.6 and later, if you are using python 1.5
    you can download and install the latest release from
    <a href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html"">python.org</a>.</p>

<p>    A C-compiler is <em>not</em> required.</p>


<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>    Gordon McMillan's
    <a href="http://www.mcmillan-inc.com/install1.html">installer</a>
    is similar to <strong>py2exe</strong>, but more mature.
    Gordon goes in great detail explaining his (and this) approach,
    and also discusses other solutions</p>

<p>    <strong>py2exe</strong> compared to <strong>installer</strong></p>

<p>    Disadvantages:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>py2exe</strong> only creates what Gordon calls <code>standalone</code>
          programs.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Since I do not use Tkinter, I did not care about that.</p>

</li></ul>

<p>    Advantages:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>py2exe</strong> is under active development (hear, hear! :-)</p>

</li>
<li><p>Complete control over python's optimization (-O and -OO flags)
        and buffering of stdout and stderr (-u flag) in the resulting
        executable</p>

</li>
<li><p>You can build debug versions of your program, which
        will also use the debugging python dll and debugging
        versions of c-extension modules</p>

</li></ul>


<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>    Provide a way to require even less files: provide more custom
    prebuilt interpreters, so that eventually everything can be packed
    into a <em>single</em> file (which can be run without unpacking anything).</p>

<p>    Look into the pythoncom and pywintypes issue.
